# The weight data is stored with MyFitnessPals default measurement id ("Weight"). For
# the other measurement values, you have to specify the custom measurement_id you want to use for it.
# For this to work, the custom measurement_ids already have to exist. You can create new ones at
# https://www.myfitnesspal.com/measurements/change. If you don't want a measurement kind to be recorded
# in myfitnesspal, just omit its mapping in the config file.
